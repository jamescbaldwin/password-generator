Homework3 focuses on creating a password generator, which will create a password at random for the user, given the parameters chosen by the user. 

Javascript will be the newest language to be implemented in this assignment, as in the past week+ we have been introduced to the UX side of web development. Although seemingly simple, creating a password generator for users has a real-world pragmatism to it that coders will almost certainly encounter as they move forward in this currculum as well as in their future fields of work.

Having reworked the code (with the hopes of learning as well as potential regrading), the password generator is now functioning properly, up to 128 characters. Below is a screenshot of a randomly generated password.
